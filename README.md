Smart Road Management System
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Smart Road Management System, a project aimed at enhancing road safety by reducing traffic accidents using big data and machine learning technologies.

Project Overview
The Smart Road Management System is designed to address the growing issue of road accidents, particularly in Egypt, by implementing a smart radar system to detect safety violations such as speeding. Our goal is to create a safer road environment by reducing traffic accidents and injuries through advanced technology.

Motivation & Problem Definition
Road Accidents Increase:

As per data from the Arab 48 newspaper (12/31/2023), road accidents increased by 5%, rising from 319 fatal accidents in 2022 to 333 in 2023, primarily due to speeding.
Data Collision Issues:

Managing diverse data effectively is a challenge, which can lead to system errors and unreliable results if not handled correctly.
High Costs of Surveillance:

Using multiple surveillance cameras to detect traffic violations is costly, impacting the system's scalability.
Traffic Congestion at Payment Gates:

Road tax and toll payment processes often cause significant traffic congestion.
Project Target (Solutions)
Violation Detection System:

Develop a system that identifies traffic infractions and helps prevent collisions, thereby enhancing road safety and reducing accidents.
Big Data Analysis:

Utilize big data to pinpoint congested and high-risk areas, optimizing road efficiency and decreasing violations.
Cost-Effective Solutions:

Implement affordable tools and devices to reduce costs for stakeholders.
Online Payment System:

Introduce an online payment system to ease traffic congestion at toll booths.
Software Development Phases
The development of the Smart Road Management System is divided into five phases:

User Interface
AI Systems
Notification and Alert
Testing Software
Big Data Integration
System Architecture
The system architecture includes multiple components that work together to analyze data, detect traffic violations, and notify users accordingly. Detailed diagrams and explanations of the architecture are available in the project documentation.

System Tools
Redis (NoSQL Database): An open-source in-memory key-value store used as a cache and quick-response database.
Apache NIFI (ETL Tool): Manages data flow, transforming, and processing it in a scalable manner.
Apache Spark: Provides a distributed computing system for big data processing and analytics.
